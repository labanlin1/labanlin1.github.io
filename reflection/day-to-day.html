        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>Day to Day is a concept I tested to help me communicate with others as I went about day-to-day life while unable to speak. Its core idea is to expedite my ability to type on my phone, which I could use to interact with people if gestures were insufficient.</p>
        <h1>Key Features</h1>
        <h2>Automatic Filtering</h2>
        <div class="day-to-day-video">
            <div class="video-wrapper">
                <video src="../assets/projects/dayToDayFiltering.mp4" muted autoplay playsinline loop preload = "metadata"></video>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Templates are automatically searched and filtered as the user types. During the search, alternate interpretations for the same meaning are examined. For example, <em>Can I get the bill?</em> and <em>Can I get the cheque?</em> are functionally identical and are represented by the same template. If the user searches for &quot;bi&quot;, the template will show the first option; if the user searches for &quot;ch&quot;, the template will show the latter.</p>
        <h2>Contextual Templates</h2>
        <div class="day-to-day-video">
            <div class="video-wrapper">
                <video src="../assets/projects/contextualTemplates.mp4" muted autoplay playsinline loop preload = "metadata"></video>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Day to Day comes with organized templates. For example, in the Restaurants section, &quot;Can I have some&quot; is a template. Selecting this template adds it to the main text input area, and supplies supporting templates: &quot;water?&quot;, &quot;coffee?&quot;, &quot;tea?&quot;, &quot;Thank you!&quot;. </p>
        <h1>Design Notes</h1>
        <h2>Keystroke Reduction</h2>
        <p>For me, reducing keystrokes was the area Day to Day could bring me the most value. It wasn&#39;t strictly a mechanical exercise; typing faster made <em>me</em> feel better. Even though I knew most people were understanding, I still <em>felt</em> like I was wasting peoples&#39; time.</p>
        <p>As a result, I made sure to include features to improve my typing time. Some of them were minor and obvious, like using the return key to clear and log the text. Additionally, I made sure templates were easy to remove - a quick tap in the main entry area will remove the template.</p>
        <p>But I had to make an interesting decision about the specificity of the templates. Too many templates would be taxing—too many to filter though, and adding marginal value. Too few, and I would have to type too often.</p>
        <p>I analyzed three options: generalization, specialization, and singular specialization. Generalization would only include templates that were exceptionally broad, such as &quot;I&#39;d like&quot;, &quot;Where is&quot;, and &quot;How can I&quot;. Specialization is the exact opposite: &quot;I&#39;d like&quot; would be represented by &quot;I&#39;d like to order&quot;, &quot;I&#39;d like to find&quot;, &quot;I&#39;d like to ask&quot;, etc. And singular specialization had just one instance of a special case, such as &quot;I&#39;d like to order&quot;.</p>
        <p>I went with singular specialization. </p>
        <p>This works great in the optimal case: suppose I wanted to type &quot;I&#39;d like to order a side salad.&quot; Compared to &quot;I&#39;d like&quot;, I save nine keystrokes—a clear winner.</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
            <tr><th>Template</th><th>Additional Typing</th><th>Keystroke Delta</th></tr></thead>
            <tbody><tr><td>I&#39;d like</td><td>to order a side salad</td><td class = "text-right">+9</td></tr><tr class = "highlight-green"><td>I&#39;d like to order</td><td>a side salad</td><td class = "text-right">-9</td></tr></tbody>
        </table>
        <p>But even in the worst case, singular specialization only suffers minor penalties—if you make it easy to remove words. </p>
        <p>In Day to Day, the trailing word in a template can be removed by pressing <code>backspace</code>. This dramatically reduces the penalty of specialization to the number of unnecessary <em>words</em> in the template, not <em>letters</em>.</p>
        <p>Consider the phrase &quot;I&#39;d like some water&quot;. The specialized &quot;I&#39;d like&quot; only costs two more keystrokes than the generic:</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
            <tr><th>Template</th><th>Additional Typing</th><th>Keystroke Delta</th></tr></thead>
            <tbody><tr class = "highlight-green"><td>I&#39;d like</td><td>some water</td><td class = "text-right">-2</td></tr><tr><td>I&#39;d like to order</td><td><code>del</code> <code>del</code> some water</td><td class = "text-right">+2</td></tr></tbody>
        </table>
        <h2>Real Estate</h2>
        <p>By building Day to Day as a website instead of a native, full-screen iOS application, I lost a sizable chunk of real estate. The status bar, Safari navigation bar, and keyboard helper take up too much space— 26% of the available screen! Had I realized how drastic this was, I would have built this as an iOS application from the start—something for me to keep in mind moving forward.</p>

        <h2>iOS Integration</h2>
        <p>iOS automatically capitalizes the first letter when an input is selected. This can be annoying; after selecting a template, typically the user expects to input an uncapitalized word. Unfortunately, I believe this level of keyboard manipulation is only available on an iOS native application.</p>
