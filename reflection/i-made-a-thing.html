            <h1>The Thing I Made</h1>
            <p>My girlfriend and I have an inside joke: once upon a time, she made a remark about being a trophy wife,
                so now I get her a trophy every year acknowledging her as the Best Girlfriend of that year. Well, I say
                every year, but I started this project in September of 2018, at which point I&#39;d only given her one
                trophy.</p>
            <p>So she was the (proud) owner of the (coveted) Best Girlfriend 2017 trophy, and I thought I could up the
                ante - what if 2018&#39;s trophy was handmade and came with lights? I should admit that this wasn&#39;t
                a fully organic thought; I had seen <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/grohliest/status/1025944951123861504?lang=en" target="_blank">this
                    tweet</a> a while back, which is a pretty similar concept, but I thought I&#39;d enjoy making a
                trophy since this was a hardware task which, as a software engineering student, I had no experience
                with.</p>
            <div class="single-image no-zoom">
                <img src="../assets/projects/trophies/tweet.png">
                <p class="caption">Source: <a href="https://twitter.com/grohliest/status/1025944951123861504?lang=en"

            </div>
            
       
            <p>Plus, we were going to be in a long-distance relationship in the upcoming school year; I was staying an
                extra year in school, while she had already graduated and moved for work, and I thought this would be a
                fun thing to have.</p>
            <p>So the idea is pretty simple: a trophy for my girlfriend that lights up when I push a button remotely.
                But to make it even cuter, I decided to build two trophies: one for each of us, and each trophy would
                have a button that would light up the other trophy.</p>
            <h1>Architecture</h1>
            <h2>Software</h2>
            <p>To handle the trophies lighting up, I built an extremely tiny server. It provides two endpoints: one to
                send a ping to a trophy, and another to check for pings. That&#39;s actually all there is to this
                server: there&#39;s not even a database of pings; the server keeps track of that in memory. I figured
                that this was fine for a server that would only ever be accessed by two trophies; if I decided one day
                to make a bunch to sell, I could always upgrade the code.</p>
            <h2>Hardware</h2>
            <p><em>*Note: if you know anything about mechatronics, this will probably be really boring, but I found this
                    really cool because I didn't know about any of this before this project.</em></p>
            <h3>Talking to the Server</h3>
            <p>First things first: the trophy needs to be able to connect to my server, so it needs an internet
                connection. I used an <a href="https://elmwoodelectronics.ca/products/13678"
                    target="_blank">ESP8266</a>, which is a networking chip with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth receivers. It&#39;s
                often used to provide an otherwise unconnected Arduino some network access, but because it also has 1MB
                of flash memory, it can also be programmed as a standalone chip. There are some libraries that make it
                pretty simple to open a HTTPS connection, which solves our first problem.</p>
            <pre><code class='language-c' lang='c'>const char* HOST = &quot;https://my-server-location.com&quot;;
const char* fingerprint = &quot;** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** **&quot;; //SHA1 SSL fingerprint

WiFiClientSecure client;
if (!client.connect(HOST, 443)) return;
if (!client.verify(fingerprint, HOST)) return;
client.print(String(&quot;GET &quot;) + &quot;/checkForPings?trophyId=1&quot; + &quot; HTTP/1.1\r\n&quot; +
             &quot;Host: &quot; + &quot;my-server-location.com&quot; + &quot;\r\n&quot; +
             &quot;Connection: close\r\n\r\n&quot;); //GETS this url
//client.readStringUntil(&quot;\n&quot;); to read each response line
</code></pre>
            <h3>Turning on the lights</h3>
            <p>The next step is to make the ESP8266 actually turn on lights. My first approach was to set an output pin
                to high and low and directly power some LEDs this way:</p>
            <pre><code class='language-c' lang='c'>const int LEDPIN = 3;
pinMode(LEDPIN, OUTPUT);
</code></pre>
            <p><strong>OFF:</strong></p>
            <pre><code class='language-c' lang='c'>digitalWrite(LEDPIN, LOW);
</code></pre>
            <div class="single-image no-zoom">
                <img src="../assets/projects/trophies/badLightsOff.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p><strong>ON:</strong></p>
            <pre><code class='language-c' lang='c'>digitalWrite(LEDPIN, HIGH);
</code></pre>
            <div class="single-image no-zoom">
                <img  src="../assets/projects/trophies/badLightsOn.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>So this does work - the light does turn on and off.</p>
            <p>The problem - which I learned of thanks to the help of technical engineering support staff at my
                university - is that the LEDs need approximately 20mA of current each, and the pins on the ESP8266 are
                not supposed to output above 12mA.</p>
            <p>So a different configuration is needed:</p>
            <div class="single-image no-zoom">
                <img  src="../assets/projects/trophies/goodLights.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>The key part here is the transistor, which will reduce the current drawn from the ESP8266.</p>
            <p>Transistors have three pins: a collector (C), a base (B), and an emitter (E). </p>
            <div class="single-image no-zoom no-fit">
                <img src="../assets//projects//trophies/transistor.png" alt="">
            
                <p class="caption">Source: <a href='https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/transistors/applications-i-switches'
                    target='_blank'
                    class='url'>https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/transistors/applications-i-switches</a></p>
                
            </div>
            <!-- <div class="no-fit">
                <img class="no-zoom" src="../assets//projects//trophies/transistor.png" alt="">
            </div> -->
           
            <p>Because this is an NPN transistor, when the base is LOW, no current flows to the emitter. When the base
                is HIGH, current flows from the collector and base to the emitter, in a way that follows two rules:</p>
            <ol start=''>
                <li>The current flowing to the emitter is the sum of the current from the base and collector</li>
                <li>The current from the collector will be N times as much as the current from the base, where N is an
                    observed property of the transistor. N is not the same value at all currents and voltages, so we
                    have to use the closest, most relevant test cases provided by the manufacturer.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The ratio in rule 2 is called the DC Current Gain or h<sub>FE</sub> on data sheets. If the lowest
                h<sub>FE</sub> for my
                configuration is 100, for example, then the current drawn from the base will be
                <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>101</sub> the amount of
                total current drawn at the emitter - so if I want to keep the ESP8266&#39;s current draw less than,
                say, 6mA, I just need to ensure that 606mA is enough to drive my LEDs.</p>
            <p>Since I have 4 LEDs in parallel, each needing 20mA, I&#39;ll need a total of 80mA provided by the
                emitter, which we definitely can have without demanding too much from the base. This is a huge
                improvement: before, just powering one LED exceeded our 12mA limit, but now with the addition of a
                transistor, we can power 4 LEDs without coming close to our limit.</p>
            <h3>Button Presses</h3>
            <p>Registering the button presses to turn on the other trophy was fairly straightforward.</p>
            <p>I defined an input pin on the ESP8266, and told it to listen to changes in the voltage. This occurred
                every time I pushed the button, because a depressed button would connect the pin to ground, and cause it
                to register LOW.</p>
            <p>When this happens, the code raises a flag.</p>
            <p>Then, every few seconds, the ESP8266 checks the flag and if it&#39;s been raised, it talks to the server
                to let it know the button has been pressed.</p>
            <pre><code class='language-c' lang='c'>//Global Flag
volatile bool sendPulse = false;

//Setup
pinMode(1, INPUT_PULLUP); //Set Pin 1 as the input pin for the button press
attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(1), pulsed, CHANGE); //Attach event listener

//Event Handler
void pulsed() {
  sendPulse = true;
}

//Main Event Loop
void loop(){
    if (sendPulse) {
        //Set up HTTPS connection and send the ping
        sendPulse = false;
    }
    //Do other stuff in the event loop
    //Sleep for a few hundred milliseconds
}
</code></pre>
            <h3>Trophy Design</h3>
            <p>So at this point, I had all the features in place, and they worked on my breadboard prototype. Before I
                could start to make a circuit board, I had to decide on a physical trophy design - this would inform the
                dimensions of the circuit board.</p>
            <p>I went through a bunch of potential designs, but I settled on an acrylic heart sat upon a David&#39;s Tea
                container. This was a fairly shoddy mockup, I&#39;ll admit, but I thought it was fairly promising.</p>
            <div class="single-image med">
                <img src="../assets/projects/trophies/heart-mockup.jpg">
                <p class="caption">Testing out different heart sizes - this one is around 14cm across, which is what I ended up using in the final product.</p>
            </div>
            <p>This meant I had to get my design onto a board that was at most 5cm wide, or else it wouldn&#39;t fit
                inside the tea container.</p>
            <h3>Circuit Boards</h3>
            <p>Some hobbyist friends helped me get set up with EagleCAD, in which we made this lovely schematic:</p>
            <div class="single-image">
                <img src="../assets/projects/trophies/schematic.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>We turned this into a board fairly easily: once the schematic is in place, EagleCAD lets you drag and
                drop components onto the board design and draw the connecting circuit paths as required. One tip that I
                got was to use the <code>ratsnest</code> feature. This basically draws an area that is one giant circuit
                path, which is really useful because it means once you draw the lines connecting your power,
                <code>ratsnest</code> can immediately ground all the remaining pins on the board.</p>
            <p>I also drew an outline of my last name in Chinese (林) for decoration.</p>
            <div class="single-image">
                <img src="../assets/projects/trophies/board.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Notice the holes in the upper left and right corners: those were drawn in so I could mount the board and
                its lights directly below the acrylic heart, so the light would shine directly into the material.</p>
            <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
            <p>The purpose was to write about the hardware, so I don&#39;t want to spend too much time discussing other
                ancillary parts, but there are few quick notable mentions:</p>
            <ol start=''>
                <li>The acrylic heart was laser cut; my school has a laser cutter that accepts a SolidWorks drawing with
                    particular line thicknesses and colors, and cuts to form.</li>
                <li>This laser cutter caught on fire after I&#39;d cut the heart but before I&#39;d cut an acrylic base
                    for the hearts to be mounted to. This meant I had to develop a 3D model of the base and have it 3D
                    printed, which is also pretty cool.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>Assembly</h3>
            <p>I couldn&#39;t find my photos of each step of the process, so I guess this is just a collection</p>
            <p>Steps:</p>
            <ol start=''>
                <li>Manufacture some holes in the David&#39;s Tea containers in the school labs</li>
                <li>Bevel the outside edges of the heart so that the heart shape will show up better</li>
                <li>Glue a trophy wallpaper to the top face of the heart base</li>
                <li>Superglue (with baking soda) the acrylic heart to the heart base</li>
                <li>Thread the </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Step 1: Gluing a trophy wallpaper to the top face of the acrylic heart base</p>
