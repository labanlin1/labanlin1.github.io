        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Long story short, I lost my voice. For six months, my voice flickered in and out, ever worsening. One day, it blew out. I could force out sounds—maybe a sentence a day if I tried—but it hurt too much to carry a conversation. Inflammation of my vocal cords, apparently. So for two months, I avoided speaking at all, waiting for medication to run its course. Although my ENT says my vocal cords now look normal, I&#39;m still having trouble speaking; my voice is pitchy and hoarse. Frankly, I don&#39;t think I sound like me. And with 8 days to go before my internship starts, we&#39;ll see what happens.</p>
        <p>This will be somewhat short: just two things. First, <em>why</em> it sucked so much—and the emotions that it carried. Then, more clinically, how <em>I</em> changed, and some general observations.</p>
        <h1>[Closed Captioning Unavailable]</h1>
        <p>In principle, I&#39;m the same person as before. I think the same way, I have the same opinions, and I want to contribute to conversations like I&#39;ve always done. That&#39;s just not possible anymore. No—I grab my phone, pull up Notes, type a slurry of words with my two thumbs and pass it around. And all the while, everyone is just staring vacantly. They&#39;re not sure where to look. At each other? No, that might make me feel left out. But no use looking at me for eye contact—I&#39;m busy typing. I type quickly, ignoring typos that can be guessed faster than corrected, and hope I&#39;m not slowing the conversation down too much. Most times, I just don&#39;t comment.</p>
        <p>Don&#39;t get me wrong: my friends are remarkably patient. They&#39;re not rushing me at all. All the same, I <em>feel</em> a sense of urgency; I <em>feel</em> like I&#39;m wasting their time; I feel like I don&#39;t deserve their attention because I can&#39;t contribute equally. </p>
        <p>These thoughts never truly fade. Every human interaction brings them back. Every workaround I have for not speaking—miming, writing notes, restructuring conversations into yes/no questions—is a deliberate reminder of my inability to speak. So too are the times I turn down invitations, decline to meet someone, or tell my friends I can&#39;t call them—but I&#39;m happy to listen to them speak and text my responses back.</p>
        <p>I may sound ungrateful—entitled, even—for not understanding my gift: that this is only temporary, and that others have it worse. I recognize that. But at the same time, <em>could I not be entitled?</em> Is that not fundamental to the human condition, to be able to speak?</p>
        <h1>Observations</h1>
        <h2>The Small Stuff</h2>
        <h3>Avoidance as Conflict Management</h3>
        <p>My conflict management strategy is avoidance. I order food via Ritual (a restaurant pre-order phone application). I frequent McDonald&#39;s more, because the location near me has a digital self-serve menu. I don&#39;t like holding up the line, and I don&#39;t like explaining that I can&#39;t talk. No, I avoid problems—and I need to be cognizant of this in the future.</p>
        <h3>I talk. A lot.</h3>
        <p>I took a trip to Waterloo with a friend, and we met up with high school friends. Even after two months of not talking, I found myself wanting to add to the conversation or comment at a high frequency. That&#39;s not necessarily bad, but something to remember—am I always adding value?</p>
        <h2>The Big Stuff</h2>
        <h3>Identity as Presentation</h3>
        <p>I attach my identity to my voice. I know it&#39;s not rational, but I do it anyway. After all, it&#39;s how I primarily communicate. And if I can&#39;t express my thoughts or feelings, what did it matter that I was still otherwise me? Did I still have an identity without my voice?</p>
        <p>I conducted a (poorly designed) experiment: I asked a few people for five words that described me. Here are the responses:</p>
        <blockquote><p>Intelligent, analytical, logical, &quot;slightly stubborn&quot;, &quot;both results oriented and process oriented. It&#39;s an interesting mix&quot;</p>
            <p>​	—Z, my girlfriend, who apparently hates counting to five</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote><p>Kind, Perceptive, Intelligent, Hard-Working, Independent</p>
            <p>​	—L, a close high school friend</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote><p>Tenacious, Determined, Loyal, Tactical, Comforting</p>
            <p>​	—T, a close friend I met through an extracurricular</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote><p>Analytical, Sharp, &quot;Heart of a Tofu&quot;, Driven, Bright</p>
            <p>​	—W, a classmate at Ivey</p>
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: Heart of a Tofu is a literal translation of the Chinese expression 豆腐心 that implies a soft heart beneath a rough/stoic exterior</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The interesting thing is that there is no mention of my voice or speech. Granted, I don&#39;t have one of those silky-smooth, made-for-radio voices. But at some point, all five of these survey respondents had told me I was articulate. (You may have noticed that hasn&#39;t translated into my writing.) Yet when pressed for words that best described me, articulate never came up. Whether for a classmate or personal confidante, the qualities that most stood out about me had nothing to do with my voice. And certainly, inability to speak impedes my ability to show that I&#39;m <em>perceptive</em> and or <em>comforting</em>. But a lot of qualities—<em>intelligent</em>, <em>analytical</em>, <em>hard-working</em>—are intrinsic. This is important for me to remember—what others see as my best traits continue to exist despite my temporary mutism. Moving forward, I will demonstrate these qualities as best I can.</p>
        <h3>Accessibility is a Tough Challenge</h3>
        <p>When I first stopped talking, it was hard to adjust. How do you tell your waiter that you can&#39;t talk? Can you order without pointing at the menu? That seems crass. And where do you go to ask these questions? I found myself lost, and unable to communicate with the world around me.</p>
        <p>To be fair, mutism cannot be managed by regulation or accessibility measures, because it&#39;s not a structural problem. It&#39;s not the same as building ramps or motorized doors or including audio jacks at ATM&#39;s—not that these solutions are perfect either. But mutism—especially when temporary—is a unique type of problem. Solutions must come from empowering the mute to speak.</p>
        <p>And sign language isn&#39;t good enough. It carries all the overhead of a new language, requiring users to learn an entirely new vocabulary and syntax. Even then, it only works if both parties understand sign language—often, that can be isolating. Maybe there&#39;s the solution: mandatory ASL-as-a-second-language high school classes. But as a Canadian who was taught French in public school, I wouldn&#39;t count on education reform to solve this problem.</p>
        <p>It&#39;s a weird feeling, on my end, to dissect a problem without the slightest notion of a solution. But on this one, I&#39;m stumped. I made a <a href='day-to-day' target="_blank">little web app</a> to help me type faster and communicate with others via phone, but it&#39;s a poor workaround. I&#39;ll put a pin in it for now; maybe one day I&#39;ll have the right tools to tackle this.</p>
