        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>I&#39;ve always wanted a personal website. That there could be a reflection of me—a curated, privacy-conscious version, but a reflection nonetheless—drifting about the internet was a fun thought. </p>
        <p>It started in high school. To augment my university applications, I put together a small Squarespace website. It had all the fancy frills, like parallax image scrolling and a responsive layout. What I loved the most, however, was its existence as a platform. I didn&#39;t just have to list <em>pilot</em> on my resume; this website could describe how I&#39;d become one, and walk the reader through the hoops I&#39;d jumped through to earn the scholarships that would let me fly. And I could use images too, to really show what I&#39;d done. It didn&#39;t matter to me that most people looking at my resume probably wouldn&#39;t visit my website. I felt that I had done my part in trying to tell my story.</p>
        <p>But over time, that website&#39;s utility faded. In freshman year, I was meeting people through clubs and case competitions, and the need to tell my story through a digital forum evaporated. Realizing that I&#39;d stopped updating the site, I eventually took it down.</p>
        <p>Ever since, I have been meaning to put together a new website. A month before my junior year, I started to apply some serious effort, and this is about why it took 10 months to finish.</p>
        <h1>Version One</h1>
        <p>In August 2016, a month before entering junior year, I sketched out a preliminary design for a personal website. The motivation: I wanted to stand out amongst finance internship candidates.</p>
        <blockquote><p>Here is some much-needed context:</p>
            <ol start='' ><li>
                I attend Western University. Its business school (Ivey) has a two-year undergraduate program that starts in a student&#39;s junior year (students can spend their first two years in any faculty). As a result, I entered business school in junior year after two years of software engineering.</li>
                <li>
                    I spent the summer before junior year in various finance internship roles, and was planning to pursue a career in finance.</li>
                <li>
                    Since I would be competing with students with more finance experience and a more relevant background (financial modeling and economics in particular), I planned to use my software engineering background as a way to stand out.</li>
            </ol>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The concept was simple: a photo, a name, some work experience, and then a portfolio of various tech projects. </p>
        <img src = "../assets/labanl.in/images/version-one-sketch-mini.JPG">
        <p>The work experience would directly relate me to the finance industry, and the subsequent projects would differentiate me from other candidates. Even if recruiters didn&#39;t read about my projects, I hoped that they would notice I had any at all, and that that alone might make a difference. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t get to test this theory; a few things came up in August and I did not finish the site on time. </p>
        <p>When September came around and recruiting started, here is how far I&#39;d gotten:</p>
        <div class="interactive-website desktop">
            <div class="controls">
                <div class = "desktop"><i class="desktop icon"></i><br><br>Desktop<br>[1920 x 1080]</div>
                <div class = "tablet"><i class="tablet icon"></i><br/><br/>Tablet<br/>[768 x 1024]</div>
                <div class = "mobile"><i class="mobile icon"></i><br/><br/>Mobile<br/>[375 x 667]</div>
            </div>
            <iframe data-src="../assets/labanl.in/v1/index.html" src = ""></iframe>
            <div class = "iframe-alternate-photos">
                <img data-src = "../assets/labanl.in/images/v1.png" src="" alt="">
            </div>
        </div>
        <h1>Version Two</h1>
        <p>First semester at Ivey flew by. There were so many people to meet, so many industries to explore, and too many people to call that I lost track of time. But I did broaden my horizons a bit. In January, I committed to the management consulting industry with a summer internship at AT Kearney.</p>
        <p>Now, free of recruiting stress, I came back to complete my website. Of course, Version One was no longer applicable. I&#39;d chosen a path in consulting, which meant my work experience would now be wildly inconsistent: web development → finance → consulting. I wasn&#39;t sure that&#39;s what I wanted visitors to notice first.</p>
        <p>As a result, I decided to go back to the basics, and simply highlight my tech projects. A fairly natural move, I thought—most personal websites seem to be online portfolios. I plodded along, developed a new sketch, and brought it to life. But then I got to about here, and then I stopped.</p>
        <div class="interactive-website desktop">
            <div class="controls">
                <div class = "desktop"><i class="desktop icon"></i><br><br>Desktop<br>[1920 x 1080]</div>
                <div class = "tablet"><i class="tablet icon"></i><br/><br/>Tablet<br/>[768 x 1024]</div>
                <div class = "mobile"><i class="mobile icon"></i><br/><br/>Mobile<br/>[375 x 667]</div>
            </div>
            <iframe data-src= "../assets/labanl.in/v2/index.html"  src=""></iframe>
            <div class = "iframe-alternate-photos">
                <img data-src = "../assets/labanl.in/images/v2_home.png" src="" alt="">
                <div class="caption">Home Page</div>
                <img data-src = "../assets/labanl.in/images/v2_timeline.png" src="" alt="">
                <div class="caption">Work Experience</div>
                <img data-src = "../assets/labanl.in/images/v2_article.png" src="" alt="">
                <div class="caption">Template Case Study</div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p><em>I know, I know,</em> that blue panel is <em>hideous</em>, and the fonts are in desperate need of more spacing. But those are simple changes, and I was concerned about a bigger issue: <em>what do I actually write about?</em></p>
        <p>This shouldn&#39;t be a hard question: the website has an obvious software slant, so I should be writing case studies on the most significant projects I&#39;ve built. However, as I mulled over my extracurricular work, I realized how many missed opportunities that would mean.</p>
        <p>Here&#39;s an example. In sophomore year, I joined a student-run non-profit called Nspire and led a new initiative called NHacks, which brought a new hackathon to my university. I signed on as hackathon chair, but (for reasons we won&#39;t get into) I ended up also developing the hackathon website&#39;s backend.</p>
        <p>I won&#39;t describe all of its features (you can read about it <a href = "nhacks.io">here</a>) but one feature of note was that this backend created name tags for each hackathon attendee. Each name tag had a custom QR code that hackathon volunteers could authenticate (using a separate iOS application I developed) to verify that the name tag was legitimate and that its owner was allowed in the building. That required a custom API on my website backend, and working out how best to design and secure an API—however small—was a pleasant learning experience.</p>
        <p>But NHacks taught me so much more than that. We were terribly understaffed, and as the hackathon approached, I questioned if we had sufficient funding. We also weren&#39;t sure how to handle transporting 300 hackers from two other cities. However, the team members that worked the hardest on these challenges (and ended up overcoming them) were the ones I&#39;d thought were least qualified when I was interviewing them eight months prior. Clearly, I was overvaluing what I saw in résumés, and work ethic and determination—so much harder to screen for—were most important in a new hire. </p>
        <p>NHacks also taught me to be proactive in managing intra-organizational politics. Before NHacks, I had a personal policy of abstaining from politics. Really, I thought politics was petty. I naïvely believed—or maybe just hoped—that everything would work out if I just did my job properly. But of course, it's never that easy. One Nspire team member, from another department, was <em>legally</em> critical to handling NHacks&#39; sponsorship money. But when he stopped doing his job, and I found myself needing political capital to pressure him into staying on task, I found that I just didn&#39;t have any. Never mind that I had always done my job properly and these issues weren&#39;t my fault—when push came to shove, people sided with those they knew the most. That was a harsh reality check.</p>
        <p>So these were the most valuable lessons I received from my time with NHacks. But on a website about my technology projects, where does that story fit?</p>
        <p>Well, it doesn&#39;t. </p>
        <p>Maybe it shouldn&#39;t—maybe that&#39;s the point. Maybe I should save that story for an interview question and use this website to showcase my code. That would make sense if this website&#39;s purpose was to get me a job. But in my time at Ivey, everyone I spoke to told me to pick a job that would teach me, that would challenge me, that would help me grow, because life is too long to just be about a single job. So in January, coming back to build this website, I wanted it to be more than just about a job—I wanted the challenges and the self-growth of designing a website.</p>
        <h1>Version Three</h1>
        <p>What you see right now is version three. It&#39;s a simple site—maybe even plain. And it has one function: this is where I publish my work.</p>
        <p>Why?</p>
        <p>Well, there&#39;s another side to this story that I haven&#39;t talked about yet, and it&#39;s about why it took 10 months to complete such a small website.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>I&#39;m not a designer—at least, not in the artistic sense. I struggle with understanding <em>why</em> something looks <em>off</em> or merely mediocre, and the solutions that seem to come so easily to some of my friends often don&#39;t come to me at all. And because a website&#39;s design is immediately judged by the visitor, I found it a harrowing experience trying to craft the perfect design. When recruiting stress piled on, I just disengaged. I&#39;m sure I could have found the time for this website, but I chose not to. And after I finished templating this Version Three, it almost happened again. As it turns out (to no surprise), I&#39;m also not a writer. </p>
        <p>Someone introduced me to Paul Kalanithi&#39;s <em>When Breath Becomes Air</em>. The writing—its cadence, its word selection—is gorgeous, and impossibly beyond my abilities (<a target = "_blank" href='http://stanmed.stanford.edu/2015spring/before-i-go.html'>here&#39;s an excerpt</a>). Again, it was demoralizing to write a reflection that I know can&#39;t compare to others I&#39;ve read. But of course, I&#39;m always going to <em>not be</em> more things than I <em>am</em>, and that can&#39;t possibly be a reason to never produce anything.</p>
        <p>There&#39;s another area for reflection here: I often think of <em>design</em> as the pretty things. That&#39;s why—in version two—I was worried about fonts and colours, and never asked myself questions like <em>who am I designing this for?</em> and <em>what do I want to show them?</em>. Writing this, I&#39;m mentally kicking myself - for crying out loud, I study software engineering. The entire field is about <em>design</em>ing systems, and the emphasis is <em>not</em> on the small, pretty flairs. It&#39;s equally true in business school: we start every case with the simple questions: who are you, and what is your role? Yes, these are clichés, but they&#39;re fundamental to the process. If I&#39;d approached the design question for this website at a more basic level, I&#39;m sure I would have come up with something like this much sooner.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>So ultimately, why this website? Because I want a forum of self-expression, and because publishing this website forces me to do so <em>knowing that my skills still need work</em>. I need to be less scared of judgment in areas where I believe I don&#39;t excel. Otherwise, I&#39;ll never have any work to show.</p>
        <h1 data-anchor = "design-notes">Design Notes</h1>
        <p>When I started working on this website, I thought that the process of fleshing out the design would be the primary focus of any write-up I did afterward. Obviously, that&#39;s not true anymore, but I figured it was still worth mentioning some  key highlights.</p>
        <h2>Reading Experience</h2>
        <h3>Font Choice: Lora</h3>
        <p>I&#39;d been taught to use sans-serif fonts on the web, but reference sites—the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, Medium—all seemed to use serif fonts with larger font-sizes for readability. As a result, I opted for one too. At first, I chose Palatino. It&#39;s an easy choice; a default font, highly legible, and attractive. However, Palatino felt just a <em>little</em> too thick. Scouring the internet for suggestions, I found a few alternatives that I liked—<a target = "_blank" href='https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hoftype/erato/'>Erato</a>, for instance—but I wasn&#39;t prepared to pay upwards of $200 for the suite. Instead, I settled on Lora, which is available on Google Fonts, and is just a tad thinner than Palatino at the same height.</p>
        <h3>Line Width: ~75 Characters</h3>
        <p>Research suggested that a line should be around <a target = "_blank" href='https://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability'>50-60 characters wide</a>. I tried this, but it felt unnaturally short; this probably had to do with all the white space on either side. Other studies suggest that up to <a target = "_blank" href='http://webtypography.net/2.1.2'>75 characters</a> in length was acceptable as well. I checked—it turns out Medium&#39;s articles are around 75 characters wide, which is what I settled on.</p>
        <h3>Visual Distractions: Back Button</h3>
        <p>For a distraction-free experience, I wanted to omit all references to anywhere outside the article, and that included the back button. A friend argued that the lack of an explicit back button was anti-user, which I suppose is fair. As a result, I&#39;ve opted to hide the back button until the cursor moves. </p>
        <p>However, it&#39;s permanently inaccessible on smaller screen sizes. I felt that with phones, the OS-level defaults for handling backwards navigation were sufficient. This may not be correct for the average user; I&#39;ll have to test this and see.</p>
        <h3>Custom Elements</h3>
        <p>At this point, it might sound like it would&#39;ve been easier to just create a Medium account and publish there. But that would let me defer the responsibility of the artistic presentation of my work, which is something I didn&#39;t want to let myself do. Even if it was going to be more work and less attractive than a Medium account, I think it was good practice to force myself to take credit (or blame) for my own design. </p>
        <p>In addition, it gave me creative freedom over the presentation of the work. I get to embed <code>iframes</code> into this web page for interactive demonstrations on desktop (on mobile, I substitute screenshots instead). That&#39;s something that I don&#39;t really get to do anywhere else, and for that reason alone, it pays to build the website myself.</p>
        <h3>External Resources: Font Awesome</h3>
        <p>For additional practice (and to reduce bloat), I avoided the use of external libraries. However, I did make an exception for Semantic UI flavoured Font Awesome icons.</p>
